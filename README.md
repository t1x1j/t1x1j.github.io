This website is purposefully sparse at the moment. It's a stylistic choice. The text here is mostly professional with a tinge of humor. That's also a stylistic choice.

**About myself: **

I own 3 cats, 2 leopard geckos, 1 snake, 1 jumping spider, and 1 tarantula. I listen to and write extreme metal. I am a big fan of computers and computer software, hence why I am a Computer Science major. I have a strong admiration for those who maintain the security of our homeland and for those who take down the bad guys who want to harm us. In my future career, I would like to work with those same people and help serve our country from a digital standpoint.

**About my education:**

I graduted from Cherry Hill High School West in 2022. I participated in the Symphonic Band for a year playing electric bass gutar, I sang as a bass in the choir for 2 years, and I was a member of the fishing club for my last 2 years of high school. Apart from that, I was an active member of the Latin Club for 4 years, participating in every possible field trip and meeting I could. 

I am a junior at Rowan University and I'm expected to graduate in the Fall of 2026 as a Bachelor of Computer Science. I joined the Advanced Cyber Systems and Usable Security (ACSUS) Laboratory in September 2025. Since joining, I have worked closely with the ACSUS Lab director on a project that covers a few different topics, including information security, general computer security, and blockchain technologies.

**About my projects: **

My first major project in the ACSUS Lab is something we call "DarkChain" - a system to show how easy it can be for a bad actor to permanently deploy inappropriate and illegal content to the Ethereum blockchain. Here's a breakdown of it without sharing too much. 

The main idea behind this project is the unfortunate presence of illegal content on the Bitcoin blockchain. A few works we cite for our project explicitly mention illegal content involving minors, which is highly detestable and a shame that it exists. While there are papers and research conducted in an effort to provide an analysis of this content and remove it from the bitcoin blockchain, similar research has not been conducted for the Ethereum blockchain. We wish for that to change and for the industry to take a strong look at how our global technology and systems can be poisoned by bad actors.

We took a look at the problem from the point-of-view of the bad guys: how would they plan to abuse the immutability of the blockchain? With that insight, we developed a system with the functionality to store and retrieve any type of content that a user desires. While it may be used for benign purposes, it was specifically designed with bad intents in mind. It uses a hierarchy of linked contracts that serve as a sort of "dark search engine" for the Ethereum blockchain. Think of a regular search engine - you can type in one keyword and be presented with millions of results. What if we use that concept to retrieve bad stufF? Other websites online have ways to remove inappropriate content, but the immutability of the blockchain prevents that. 

**About my career and interests:**

I am currently employed at BJ's Wholesale Club and have been for over 4 years now. It has taught me strong personal skills involving communication between customers, team members, and management. It has also taught me time management (the time it takes for my department to do its work is a very key metric) skills, a strong work ethic, and how to do a good job and be proud of it.

My interests include: blockchain technologies, distributed systems, cryptocurrencies, cryptography, criminal justice, computer hardware, and how information can be used for both good and bad and the intersection between those two opposites. 

Regarding my future career aspirations, I would love to work for a government agency that deals with cybercrime. I think crime in general is disgusting, but cybercrime is abhorrent with the levels of degeneracy it can reach. The dissemination of illegal content such as illegal drugs, illegal marketplaces, and illegal imagery and videos is a misuse of the Internet and I wish to do my best to help those who want to stop it. I think the Internet itself is great - but it should not be used for anything distasteful or illegal.
